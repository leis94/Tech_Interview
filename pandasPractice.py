Second Part: Create your code.

In this module you should implement a code that reads the file
nba.xlsx (taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe/)
and import it as a pandas dataframe and process it.

There should be functions or methods that:

0) Read and import excel file into pandas dataframe (df)
1) Prints the df
2) Return a df with a single given column from the original df
3) Return a list or array (explain choise) from a given column
4) Return a sub-dataframe filtered by a column value
5) Return the merge of two dataframes (you can use the nba2.xlsx)
   with an inner join.
6) Output a given dataframe to an excel file.


Third Part: Challenge yourself
            Implement a simple API in Django with a storage
            in Postgresql that uses the methods for processing
            developed with pandas.
